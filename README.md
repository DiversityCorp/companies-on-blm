<h1>We are focused on holding companies accountable.</h1>
<h3>In response to the Black Lives Matter, many companies posted simple soldarity statements without committing to actual change.
We want to hold companies accountable by highlighting the change (or lack of change) they have implemented in their teams, as well as the diversity of the leadership in their company.</h3>
