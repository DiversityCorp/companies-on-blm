# Why are we here?

We are focused on holding corporations accountable.

In response to the Black Lives Matter, many corporations posted simple solidarity statements without committing to actual change.
We want to hold corporations accountable by highlighting the change (or lack of change) they have implemented in their teams, as well as the diversity of the leadership in their corporation.

# How to get started

### Implementation Notes

- `companies/` has the company data. All that is required is the company value.
- look in the `examples` folder for a template on how to add data for a company.
- This site uses two layouts:
  - `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: the top-level HTML structure
  - `_includes/layouts/company.njk`: the company page template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
