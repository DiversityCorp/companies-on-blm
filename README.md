# This project is now closed

We started this project in 2020 as a practice in Open Source programming and promoted it during Hacktoberfest.  We are so thankful for everyone who contributed and we all learned a lot about how to organize and run an open source project.  Our efforts are now better spent on different projects and we will no longer be making changes to this repository.

We would like to point you toward [What's missing from corporate statements on racial injustice? The real cause of racism](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/05/1008187/racial-injustice-statements-tech-companies-racism-racecraft-opinion/) by Amber M. Hamilton for analysis and commentary on corporate statements from 2020.

# Why are we here?

We are focused on holding corporations accountable.

In response to the Black Lives Matter, many corporations posted simple solidarity statements without committing to actual change.
We want to hold corporations accountable by highlighting the change (or lack of change) they have implemented in their teams, as well as the diversity of the leadership in their corporation.

### Implementation Notes

- `companies/` has the company data. All that is required is the company value.
- look in the `examples` folder for a template on how to add data for a company.
- This site uses two layouts:
  - `_includes/layouts/base.njk`: the top-level HTML structure
  - `_includes/layouts/company.njk`: the company page template (wrapped into `base.njk`)
