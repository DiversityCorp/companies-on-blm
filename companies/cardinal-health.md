      “I can’t breathe.”

      "George Floyd’s death should never have happened. Inhumanity against one is inhumanity against all. This has to stop. All of us have a responsibility to encourage unity and demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and too many others whose lives have been cut short by racism throughout our country’s history. We must come together so that everyone enjoys the same privilege of living, working and raising their families in a community that is safe for all.”
