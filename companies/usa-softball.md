      USA Softball is built upon a foundation of providing equal opportunities for anyone to participate in the game of softball.
      All persons should be treated with dignity and respect and there is no room nor tolerance for racism within outr community.
      We recognize that this is a societal problem and that we must use our position as the leader in the sport to promote inclusiveness.
      We encourange our community to show empathy towards others and to join us in advocating for equality for all.
