      For ten days, we’ll be giving $50,000 to an organization working for justice in a different facet of their community. We’ll also be matching payments sent to their $cashtags.

      Dismantling systemic racism and building a society that values Black lives needs support from every corner.

      Words aren't enough. Action drives action.
