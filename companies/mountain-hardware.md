      We’ve been quiet these last few days, as we’ve been grieving, processing, and searching for the right words… There are no right words.

      Racism and systemic inequality are much bigger than recreating outdoors, but we’re taking a stand in the ways we know how, as these issues have persisted in our community. Until we can provide more actionable solutions for you, we simply want to make our beliefs known:
      Black lives matter, and we stand in solidarity with the people who are demanding justice for George Floyd as well as the aggression that came before it. Silence is not helping our Black employees, neighbors, climbing partners, mountain guides, ski patrollers, and community members at large, and we won’t stop until we are better. Silence is not creating a world where Black people feel safe and welcome in the mountains, at the crag, the backcountry, campgrounds, our parks, and in those quiet places where many of us seek comfort.

      We’re working from the inside out to listen, learn, and make changes to better support Black experiences and uplift their voices in outdoor spaces and beyond. We will no longer remain silent about the profound gap in our freedoms to enjoy these places, which is why you can expect us to hold ourselves accountable to diversifying our representation and elevating melanated stories.

      We urge you to show up by listening and following folx who have been speaking out and are leaders on this issue. We’ll be sharing voices from people of color (POC) in our community in the coming days, but in the meantime, we are pausing our account to help amplify them in this time.

      If this is what you believe, too, know that we’re with you in doing better.
