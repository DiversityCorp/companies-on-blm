      We cannot stand silent while blatant injustices happen daily to our brothers and sisters. We must do better. We must change.

      But we know just posting about injustice isn't enough. All of us here at Ibex know that we must build diversity and justice into the foundation of our company and not tolerate hate of any kind.

      We are adding Diversity in the Outdoors to one of our core values as a company. The outdoors are for everyone, not just a small percentage - every human has the right to experience, explore and feel safe in natural areas. We are committed to partnering with organizations and individuals who promote diversity in outdoor recreation and conservation.

      We've posted in our stories actionable steps we are taking to fight racism in the outdoors and be a part of change to make sure all people feel safe and included.
