      Orvisâ€™ vision is to inspire the world to love the adventure and wonder in nature. For us, an inspired world is one that is inclusive, equitable and without barriers. One that is achieved by acknowledging privilege, exploring blind spots, and engaging in important and uncomfortable conversations.

      We are deeply saddened by the pain and unrest across our country. Anti-blackness and racism have no place in our world. We stand in solidarity with our friends and community members in demanding equity.

      The outdoor recreation and fly-fishing communities are not immune from what we are seeing. We know not everyone feels invited, included, or sometimes even safe to participate in fly fishing. We also know that we, Orvis, are far from perfect, and that there is a lot of work to do. But we are committed to engaging, and we understand that there are many of us in the established angling community who need to step up and lead. It has to be our responsibility if change is going to happen.

      We ask everyone in the outdoor and angling communities to join us in expressing a commitment to combat racism of any kind, a willingness to engage in this conversation, and an obligation to create change and create a more equitable fly-fishing culture, outdoor community and greater world. #blacklivesmatter
