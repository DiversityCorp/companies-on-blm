      As humans, we are deeply saddened and hurt by the acts of violence that have taken place. We realize to take a step forward, it’s necessary to take a step back. We are taking an introspective look at how we conduct business and how we approach the outdoor space. Our goal and mission have always been to create a safe environment for people to enjoy the outdoors, whether that is on the top of a mountain or in their own backyards. This isn’t enough. We must do better and be better. We know that climbing and mountaineering have long been pursuits that are exclusive and full of barriers. Today, we take a step back and begin creating a plan and strategy that contributes to lasting and meaningful change. Concrete actions that break down these barriers and create a safe and inclusive space in the outdoors. The work starts now. We vow to be a brand that listens and acts upon our learnings because together, we are stronger.
      .
      Today, we don’t have all the answers. Today, we are listening and learning. Talk without action doesn’t create change, so please let us know how we can be better and more inclusive.
