      We believe the outdoors is for everyone. No matter who you are, where you came from, who you love or how you move, we should all be able to safely enjoy the power of being outside, or wherever life takes us. We recognize that not everyone has the privilege to get outside safely and without fear. There is a problem and we will not stay silent. We stand with everyone advocating for justice today and every day. There are simple ways to take action such as furthering your knowledge around systemic issues, taking less than one minute to text “FLOYD” to 55156, or signing this petition to bring #justiceforgeorge: https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd
