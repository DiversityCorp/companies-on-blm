    raw_text: Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby shared the following message with employees,

I do not usually communicate with you about non-business issues, but I cannot remain silent in the wake of recent events. I am struggling with outrage, sadness and frustration at the tragic death of George Floyd, which followed so closely on the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. We grieve for Mr. Floyd and his family and friends as well as for the larger community of which he was a part.
People of color in the United States are too often denied basic human rights that many of us take for granted. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect and have access to equal justice. Racism has no place in a civilized society.

I know many of you are also dealing with your own range of emotions in response to these recent events, and others might be struggling to fully understand the anger and frustration we are witnessing in communities across the country. These tragedies present us with an opportunity to listen and work to understand the experiences and perspectives of those who have suffered the destructive effects of racism.

As Caterpillar employees, Our Values in Action require each of us to respect all people and their opinions, experiences and backgrounds. I ask you to reflect on your individual thoughts and actions and ensure they are consistent with Our Values.

In addition to our individual actions, Caterpillar will support the fight against racism and injustice. In honor of the lives taken and with a mission to help build a better world, the Caterpillar Foundation will make a donation to an appropriate organization that will be announced in the near future. I also encourage you to take advantage of our Caterpillar Foundation Matching Gift Program to support those organizations most important to you, your family and your communities in the fight against racism and injustice.

Thank you for living our Caterpillar Values every day.
