      Racism of every kind is unconscionable. The images and news stories we are seeing about the treatment of black people in America today are incredibly tragic. 

      I stand with my black colleagues 
      @okta
      and the entire community as we work together for a more just and kind society.

      Lots of work to do toward this goal, it can feel daunting but one thing we should all do is vote. Vote, Vote, Vote!!!!
