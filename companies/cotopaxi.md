      Weâ€™re appalled and heartbroken at the persistent and violent evidence of racism in our country. Today and every day, Black Lives Matter.

      Creating a more equal and just world has been at the heart and soul of our brand, but in response to recent events, we feel compelled to do more to combat racial injustice. It is our duty to stand up and confront one of the most important issues facing our country. As a part of these efforts, we are providing an immediate grant to the @naacp through the Cotopaxi Foundation and are committing to future grant programs around this issue.

      Here, we are sharing our commitments so that you can hold us accountable:
      We pledge to use our resources, our platform, and our voice to support racial equality.
      We pledge to promote equality in the workplace through training and policies that promote diversity and inclusion.
      We pledge to listen to and act on suggestions from community members on how to be a better partner in combating racial injustice.
      We pledge, as an outdoor company, to continue to push for inclusiveness in our industry.

      Join us in standing together to create meaningful change. What will you do in your own communities to make a difference? Leave your pledge in the comments. #BlackLivesMatter
