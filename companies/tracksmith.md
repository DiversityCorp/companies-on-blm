      "As runners know, change doesn’t come easy. I hope your discomfort leads you to growth. To those who aren’t Black, have the hard conversations even when there hasn’t been an incident on the news. Black people are being murdered. Do more than run for a hashtag. Do more than repost something for 24 hours. Do your own research on the systems in place that lead to injustice. Then do the actions necessary to leave a lasting positive impact on your community. Make a difference. Your Black teammate is begging you. Black lives matter." - @kamilahjournet
