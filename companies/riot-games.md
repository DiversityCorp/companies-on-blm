    raw_text: Riot Games stands in solidarity with the Black community against all acts of injustice, racism, prejudice, and hatred. Silence is not an option. Let our collective voices rise and our actions make "progress" a reality. Now is the time to unite through our skills, talents, and time in the most impactful ways possible. Our communities of color deserve more. Black lives matter.
