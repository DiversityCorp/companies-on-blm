        We Stand for Our People Dear Friends, The intentional violence and weapon of United States racism in the outdoors is so pervasive and strong, that even a bird watching enthusiast in an iconic urban park could not escape it. This is why Outdoor Afro exists. Birds are a beloved and beautiful symbol of freedom; borderless in both spirit and movement to roam for their sustainability. A stark contrast to the continued constraints Black people far too often feel and experience on the same earth we share with birds, wildlife, and other humans. With as much progress as Outdoor Afro has led in the last decade, the continued open-season on Black bodies in the outdoors remains horrifying — and makes it understandable why so many of our folks won&#39;t go to parks anywhere in this country, especially alone. America has a dark and very recent past where Black lives were terrorized, maimed, and taken in wilderness settings. Today our people still experience all kinds of passive and aggressive behavior in nature from fellow park users while simply trying to recreate. The difference here is that the incident in New York City’s Central Park was filmed, and that brother Black man is also a board member of an esteemed wildlife conservation organization. But few Black people have these credentials along with a fleeting chance to capture on film the unexpected timing when racism strikes — this is why it is Outdoor Afro’s explicit and evergreen mission to make sure all Black people, regardless of their affiliations or outdoor skills, can be treated with respect in nature at all times, anywhere and, at minimum, absolutely without the threat of violence. Outdoor Afro will continue to  support our communities, online and in real life, through empowered connections with nature, where Black people can be our full selves: beautiful, strong, and free. Our national volunteer network of trained leaders will continue with even greater resolve to share words of inspiration and hope, while planning healing outdoor events, including birdwatching, in public lands that belong to everyone. Your support continues to help us do this life affirming and critical work. Peace and Nature, Rue Mapp CEO &amp; Founder

        A MESSAGE FROM OUTDOOR AFRO: First, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude for the outpouring of support we have received over the past several days, in the form of new followers and monetary donations. For eleven years, Outdoor Afro has supported our communities, online and in person, through empowered Black connections and Black joy in nature. Our national volunteer network of trained leaders will continue with even greater resolve to create a safe and welcoming environment for our communities in nature. Secondly, we would like to tell you a little more about the work that we have been doing for more than a decade. On behalf of Black people, Outdoor Afro works from our Oakland, CA, Washington D.C. offices and established state networks to: Encourage national, regional, and local leaders to protect America&#39;s public lands and waters, including recreational opportunities and the jobs they support. Empower more Black people to become informed and empowered advocates to protect public lands with policymakers in Washington D.C., as well as in their states, counties, cities, and towns. Support increased Black participation and Black executive leadership in the Outdoor Recreation Economy. Champion outdoor industry brands that share Outdoor Afro&#39;s commitment to equity, access to parks for all, and value sustainable global supply chains that respect human rights and the environment. Engage with companies, not-for-profits, and leadership to ensure that no communities disproportionately carry the costs of climate change. Advocate for increased transportation funding to lower barriers to nature, so that more people, especially youth and their families, can have efficient, affordable means to get outdoors - especially to those places close to home. Defend the protection of sacred public lands and the communities that depend on them. Promote culturally competent programming and staffing in parks to help more people feel welcome and understood in those spaces through outreach, on-site participation, and lifelong engagement. Create more synergies with non-traditional conservation allies such as clergy, creatives, entertainers, social justice warriors, public health professionals, retail organizations, and other consumer industries. Recognize the need to protect wildlife and their habitats as part of a healthy human ecosystem, while also supporting lawful and sustainable hunting and fishing practices. Lastly, for everyone looking for ways to move the needle and drive change, we encourage you to support forward-moving not-for-profit organizations and continue to lift up Black voices.
