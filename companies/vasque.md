      We are painfully saddened and outraged by the senseless death of George Floyd here in our home state of Minnesota. There are no words to fully express our condolences to the families and Black communities who bare this grief and this suffering, but saying nothing is unacceptable.

      One of the values that drives us to do our work every day is the truth that time spent in nature is a powerful way to heal, yet we know that until everyone in our community has the same opportunity for safety, for respect, for life, there can be no reprieve for any of us.

      As we watch the frustration of centuries of systemic and brutal racism erupt in our backyard it is clear to us that our work now, as a white-led organization, is to listen, to learn, to show up, to donate, and to use our voice to help create the change that is desperately needed in our communities. This is not the world that we want to pass on to the next generation, and we will not stop until peace and equity is no longer just a dream.

      Allison Gettings, Vasque President
