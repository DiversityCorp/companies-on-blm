      We have stayed silent too long.
      There is systemic racism haunting the communities we love. We felt as though an Instagram post without action couldn’t meaningfully address this systemic problem – but we realize that an issue this entrenched must be named, and we must speak up.
      This has been a humbling process for us. As a business and as an industry we haven’t always gotten it right, and have a long way to go.
      We are committed to taking action to change, no matter how long it takes. Racism, injustice and violence need to stop. We stand in solidarity with black lives in communities around the world.
      We marvel at the strength of joining together to confront injustice, and will use our voice to seek justice where we live, work, and play.
      We promote the positive power of humans to be problems solvers. We will educate whenever and wherever we can. We commit to ensuring that every single human feels at home in everything we do.
      The outdoors is for everyone. This world is for everyone. We cannot stop until every person is welcomed equally.
