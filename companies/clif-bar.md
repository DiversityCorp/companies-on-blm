      We believe in change. We believe the racial injustice Black Americans face every day can and must change. And we believe the inequities dividing us all can change. But change doesn't happen by itself. Clif Bar & Company stands with the people and organizations who are fighting to ensure that Black Americans are treated with dignity, respect, and equality. Today, we are donating $100,000 to Color Of Change and our longtime partner the African Peopleâ€™s Education and Defense Fund (links for both below). Because change can't stand still. #blacklivesmatter
