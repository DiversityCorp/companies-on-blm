      We are deeply saddened, angered, distressed and outraged by the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony Mcdade and Breonna Taylor due to police brutality and the continuous violence against Black people in the United States. We demand justice for them and the countless others whose names and stories have not made it to mainstream media. In the wake of the hundreds of protests around the world, we are now fearful for our lives as we realize more and more that it could have just as easily been one of us. We are calling for an end to the senseless violence and police brutality against Black people and will be using our platforms to promote peace, tolerance and solidarity with our Black audiences, clients, talent, and most of all, our employees and contractors who joined protests and fought in the streets to demand change.
      As we gasp for air and tread to protect our mental health, we encourage our allies and friends to be mindful of our struggle. This is not the first or the last of these atrocities and the pain we feel, endure and navigate will never be healed. What we need is support. What we need is compassion. What we need is for everyone to speak up and advocate. Though these issues may make you feel uncomfortable, we challenge you to stand in your truth and address these issues head-on. Take the time to educate yourselves. In that process, you will learn that we are not all in this together. Black people have been carrying the weight of bias, prejudice and racism for too long. It’s time for everyone else to step up.
      As a media company, Condé Nast leads the charge in purveying and cultivating culture, and we hope to lead the charge on making a difference for the communities that so help shape the content we all know and love. We’re thankful to the brands that have been covering topics that affect the black community prior to recent events. We will continue to work together internally and externally to make Condé Nast a leader in supporting underrepresented communities on a regular basis across our brands.
      As a company, we will be supporting #BlackLivesMatter and making corporate monetary donations to organizations supporting the victims, protestors and supporters in this latest wave of racial injustice. We are also pledging $1,000,000 in advertising support across our platforms to help give voice to non-profit organizations combating racial injustice.
      We can and should always be doing more. This is just a start.
