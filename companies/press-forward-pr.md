      As a PR agency, we help to shape the conversation: We push messaging, highlight products and showcase initiatives within sport, sustainability, food, health and wellness. But sheltered by our privilege and challenged to use it for good, our agency and the industries we serve must do better.⠀
      ⠀
      In the wake of the last week, never have the words of cyclist and activist Ayesha McGowan (@ayesuppose) meant more: ⠀
      ⠀
      “Silence is agreement." ⠀
      ⠀
      Today, we’re making changes at Press Forward. We’re committing firstly to the following: -We will press clients on greater representation and messaging around communities of color, emphasizing diversity. When appropriate, we will work with clients to constructively call out police brutality against Black people. ⠀
      ⠀
      Today we’ll make a $1000 donation to Black Lives Matter (@blklivesmatter) and $1000 the @ACLU. We commit to continued financial support for anti-racism efforts. We’re committed to hiring more diverse content creators, photographers and videographers. ⠀
      ⠀
      Perhaps most far-reaching, beginning today, we’ll suspend recommending any spend on Facebook and Instagram in the wake of the platform’s unwillingness to support fact-based journalism. One of the roles of an agency in our space is to hold up the people and publications we love. ⠀
      ⠀
      The effect of this lack of integrity around fact-based journalism has a disproportionate effect on Black communities, in addition to hurting the media we love.⠀
      ⠀
      We invite other ad planning agencies to join us in pushing back misinformation and to encourage fact-based dialogue about the issues we face. ⠀
      ⠀
      We speak up today because we are sad and angry at the death of George Floyd, and we stand in solidarity with protestors demanding a better future. ⠀
