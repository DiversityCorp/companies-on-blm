      Silence is not an option. Posting on Instagram is not enough. It’s important to understand that this is coming 400yrs too late. Our country is and has been denying basic human rights to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), and we must stand in solidarity against White Supremacy, Systemic Racism, and Police Brutality. We’re committed to protesting, voting, donating, listening to and elevating BIPOC voices, and creating short-term and long-term goals within our company to make sure we’re doing what we can to support the changes needed in our country and our industry. Please reach out to us directly if you see areas where we can improve.
      We encourage all those in our community to use your platform to show support, but make sure you’re continuing the conversation in real life and turning that into real action. People's lives are not a trend.
