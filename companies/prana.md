      Grief. Frustration. Anger. Confusion.
      Fear. Guilt. Exhaustion.
      Words fail to capture these feelings.
      Action is required.

      In trying to understand these feelings, how to express them, and how to respond, we waited. We realize now the waiting in and of itself was a privilege we took for granted, and our silence spoke for us.

      We stand with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and their families.

      We stand with those speaking out against racism in Minneapolis and cities around the world.

      We stand with anyone impacted by racism and social injustice.
      Today, we stand up to listen.

      We understand we have the responsibility to listen, learn, and act. We want to inspire a conversation that focuses on the opportunity for change before us. Please know this is just the beginning.

      Collaborating with you is important to us. What specific measures would you like to see us take as we fight racism and social injustice?
