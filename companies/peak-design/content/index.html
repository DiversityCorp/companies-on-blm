        Businesses need to speak up. They cannot be silent while another black person is killed in America.⁠⠀
We just made a donation to @aclu_nationwide, @naacp, and @splcenter. Those donations are not some sort of magic fix for deeply ingrained and systematic racism, but they do help put resources into the hands of those who fight day in and day out for racial and social justice. It is a start.⁠⠀
We challenge 5 businesses we admire, @patagonia @rei @kickstarter @huckberry and @nomad, to use their platforms to speak up about racism, and make a donation of their own. It is time to #saysomethinggiveanything⁠⠀
Issue a statement, post an Instagram story, send a newsletter. Seek out the wisdom and lessons of those who have been fighting this fight longer than you. Support your customers and employees. And encourage 5 other companies you love to do the same. Silence is unacceptable. ⁠⠀

      <h2>Blog
        posted
        29 May 2020</h2>
      <p class="statement">
        Today we donated to the ACLU, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. We also asked five companies we admire to speak up about racism, make donations of their own, and to encourage five other companies to do the same. We hope that #saysomethinggiveanything catches on.
A single social post or donation is not a lot. But it&#39;s something. And if there is one thing we urge other companies to say or do right now in response to the death of George Floyd, it&#39;s something. Anything.
Say George Floyd&#39;s name. Say this is wrong. Say anything. Don&#39;t be silent while another black person is killed.
For the past 48 hours, the internal dialogue at Peak Design has been heated. We&#39;re depressed and outraged.
What should Peak Design say? Do we condemn the actions of the officers and call for them to be charged with murder? Do we speak to this incident in the greater context of the endless string of killings of unarmed black people? Do we find a leader in civil rights advocacy and amplify their message? Do we relate the incident to racism and prejudice in the outdoor industry (of which there is plenty)?
Yes. We say any of those things, or all of those things. What&#39;s necessary is that we say it.
We say it, even if the investigation is pending and the details are still unfolding. We say it, even when the internal dialogue about diversity and equity at our company is unresolved and evolving. We say it, knowing that we&#39;ll piss off a few of our own customers.
Here is what we want to say:
We live in a country where people of color—people who are our family, friends, customers, partners, and our own coworkers—live in fear of the police.
Racism is so deeply embedded, that it knows no political or socioeconomic boundaries.
We&#39;re having a monumental election in 5 months—one that will shape our country&#39;s dialogue surrounding racial and social justice for the next 4 years and beyond.
It&#39;s in our mission to use our voice to inspire positive change. We will not &quot;just stick to making products.&quot;
The change we seek includes accountability in policing, criminal justice reform, increased representation in all sorts of places (like the outdoors), and businesses getting off the sidelines and using their platforms to address racism.
We&#39;re not going to pretend like we have the silver bullet to fix everything.
Peak Design will continue examining our own practices in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity at our company, industry, and society. We will continue to speak up when there is something to say, even if we don’t know exactly what the right thing to say is. When silence is the alternative, we would rather stumble than do nothing.
Many other companies are striving to do the same. If you’re one of those companies, now is the time to say something. Issue a statement, post an Instagram story, send a newsletter. Seek out the wisdom and lessons of those who have been fighting this fight longer than you. Support your customers and employees. And encourage other companies you love to do the same.
Because right now, something is better than nothing.
And if you&#39;re not sure where to start....
