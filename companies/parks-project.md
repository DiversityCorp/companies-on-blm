      Silence is compliance.
      We're taking a break from our regularly scheduled programming to show solidarity with the black community and those mourning the murder of George Floyd.
      Justice begins with accountability and requires all of us commit to combating racism-individuals, community members, and organizations.
      It begins with acknowledging that there's a problem.
      It begins with committing to being part of the solution.

      Being part of change means taking actionable steps. Here’s what we’re doing:

      1. We’re assembling an advisory council on diversity and inclusion in the outdoors to ensure that our business represents and amplifies the voices of people who have not been historically welcomed or encouraged to take part in the outdoors.
      2. We’re actively researching organizations to which we can donate funds and resources—we’re looking forward to updating you once we’ve consulted with our council and chosen the one we think best represents the change we want to see.
      3. We’re listening. We’re paying attention to leaders and organizations that are committed to speaking against injustice and inequality, paying attention to our audience, and paying attention to the things that are happening in our communities and communities across the country.
