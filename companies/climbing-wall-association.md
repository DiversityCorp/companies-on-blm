      We are answering the call to #AmplifyMelanatedVoices this week by muting our usual content June 1 â€“ 7. Thank you @jessicawilson.msrd and @blackandembodied for initiating this movement.

      During this time, we will focus our social feeds on amplifying the voices of those who are doing the work in the climbing community. We must all take this time to listen and reflect on how we can do better.

      We support everyone who is standing up against racism and police brutality.
