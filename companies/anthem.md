      There are times in life for listening and quietly observing the events and discussion around us. And then, there are times that move us to speak out.

      Anthem is rooted in the very fabric and history of local communities that have found themselves under siege the past several days. These are the local communities where we not only live and work, but it’s where we serve others through a lens of inclusion, acceptance and tolerance.

      What began as a horrific act of inhumanity at the hands of Minneapolis police last Monday soon escalated into destruction and violence in the many places we call home. What we’ve witnessed this past weekend by small groups of individuals across the country has ultimately detracted from the lawful protests and the desired narrative around ‘peace’.

      The events have also illuminated the very real and important issues that we need to face—together—around inequity, bias and intolerance. We cannot sit idly by. We can and must do better as a nation.

      Martin Luther King once said: “An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.”

      Today, I ask all of us to rise above and reach out in support of one another. That’s what we’ve always done at Anthem. As we continue to battle this pandemic and now social unrest, I urge everyone of us to demonstrate compassion during this unsettling moment in our history.

      Anthem and the Anthem Foundation Stand in Solidarity with Communities Across the Country
      Pledge $50M Aimed at Impacting Social Injustice and Health Inequities

      INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 8, 2020-- As an organization that’s committed, connected, and invested in our communities, Anthem is speaking out and taking action against long-standing social injustice, racial inequality and health disparities in America. Today, Anthem and the Anthem Foundation, announce additional commitments to drive national change, with a $50 million pledge over the next five years focused on directly impacting racial injustice, strengthening our communities and addressing health inequities. With our 75-year history in local communities, Anthem is compelled by our values to improve the lives and health of communities and help build a better, more equitable and healthier America.

      “The effects of COVID-19, together with the recent social unrest, have further illuminated the racial inequities and health disparities that have historically plagued our communities for far too long. These local communities, where we live and work, are also where we serve others through the lens of inclusion, acceptance, and belonging. That focus will not change,” said Gail K. Boudreaux, President and CEO of Anthem, Inc. “We pledge to be a leader and work in solidarity with our communities to challenge the status quo, and address the factors driving disparities in our healthcare system and in society as a whole.”

      Today’s investment will reinforce and strengthen long-standing partnerships with national and community organizations that are working tirelessly to combat systemic racial inequality and health inequities. The Anthem Foundation partners with more than 4,000 nonprofit organizations that work every day to identify healthcare needs and address social drivers that impact the health of individuals, and our communities. As we build upon this legacy, Anthem and its Foundation will work side-by-side with new and existing partners to find ways to unify and ways to foster conversations around these issues and open an important dialogue for all Americans. Anthem is committed to creating enduring change in communities across the country, especially in our home town of Indianapolis.

      We know that crafting and implementing innovative solutions starts locally, and today the Anthem Foundation is providing additional funds to help rebuild and transform our communities that have been impacted by the recent social unrest. Our goal is to ensure that people, their families and businesses can reach their fullest potential in their communities in the years ahead:

      We are dedicating funding to support community partners that will work to help revive and rebuild neighborhoods in Indianapolis and the communities we serve across the country
      We will be working with nonprofits across the country focused on health opportunities, economic development and job creation
      As we look to make a lasting impact, Anthem is also focused on living our values at home. We know that every day our associates are actively supporting their communities and today that call to action has never been greater. We support and join them in their efforts to lift up our individual and collective voices as the Anthem family of associates align with those organizations that are fighting for equality and against racism and social injustice:

      We are expanding our associate giving opportunity by providing a 1:1 match for their contributions to the following organizations: National Urban League, United Negro College Fund (UNCF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Boys and Girls Clubs of America (BGCA), Race Forward, and United Way.
      Anthem’s associates are passionate and dedicated to supporting their communities and with the help of our Associate Resource Groups, we will engage in deeper and meaningful activities to address health disparities and racial injustices in our communities. And through our Dollars for Doers Program they will be able to raise additional funds for a nonprofit of their choice.
      Anthem is committed to lifting-up our local communities during this difficult but important time of change and working each day to ensure that all people, across all of our communities, are part of a healthier, more hopeful nation.
