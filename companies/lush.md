      We say enough.
      Violent beatings and killings must end.
      Racial profiling must end.
      Mass incarceration must end.
      Impunity must end.
      Racism against black communities must end.
      Suffering must end.
      Black Lives Matter.
      Staying silent is not an option.
      Enough.
