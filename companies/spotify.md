      We stand with the Black community
      - our employees, our partners, artists
      and creators - in the fight against
      racism, injustice and inequity.
      
      Now is not the time for silence.
      
      We will continue to use the power of
      our platform to amplify Black voices
      so they are heard.

      June 2 is Black Out Tuesday, a day of collective disconnect from work meant to help people reflect and come together in support of the Black community. On this day—and every day—Spotify will support our employees, friends, partners, artists, and creators in the fight against racism, injustice, and inequity.
      
      We have also encouraged all employees around the world to observe Black Out Tuesday by taking time to reflect and educate themselves. We have shared resources on what it means to be an effective ally to the Black community, and Spotifiers will have access to trained mental health providers. Additionally, Spotify will match financial donations made by employees to organizations focused on the fight against racism; injustice; inequity; and driving meaningful change. Following Black Out Tuesday, we will also come together as a global community for a facilitated discussion about racial injustice.

      Now is not a time for silence, and Spotify stands with the Black community. As our support continues to evolve, we hope that these initial steps and actions will help push these conversations forward, promote deeper allyship, and usher in positive and lasting changes.
