      “We stand together with all victims of racism and all who speak out and act against racial injustice.

      But this is not just about those who hold leadership positions. We are all in a position to lead. I am reminded of the powerful words of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall:

      ‘Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.’

      Gert always drove relentless improvement by saying, ‘It’s perfect, now make it better.’ On the topic of racism, society is more than imperfect, and we must all be relentless in the effort to make it better.”

      –TIM BOYLE, CEO, Columbia Sportswear Company
