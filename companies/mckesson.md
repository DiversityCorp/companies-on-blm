      A Message from McKesson CEO Brian Tyler:
      I've watched the recent events with heartbreak and outrage, deeply saddened by the persistent existence of racism in our society and the impact it continues to have on the Black and other POC communities.

      As CEO, I recognize I am in a position of privilege, and with that privilege comes a great responsibility.  Our collective heartbreak and outrage are not enough.  If we are going to see the meaningful change we seek, we must commit to taking action - not just when an incident happens, but every moment and every day.

      Today, our company came together to have an open and candid discussion about how we can all live out our shared commitment to inclusion.  We will gather, we will listen, and we will support each other.  We talk a lot internally about being together, let's be together now in this moment and in our future.

      Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

      Today and every day, I stand in solidarity with our colleagues and the patients, customers, and communities we serve as we commit to be a part of the solution.  In these challenging times, I am hopeful about the power of what we can achieve if we are willing to stand up for justice and support one another.
