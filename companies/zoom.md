      Hello my fellow Zoomies,

      I hope this note finds you doing as well as is possible in this unique moment around the world. COVID has brought pain, loss, ambiguity, and despair for many, in particular, vulnerable communities. The Black Community in the United States has been severely impacted, and coupled with the pandemic, has also experienced shocking and senseless killings that have occurred or been brought to light over the past couple of weeks involving Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.

      To be clear, the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations and the individual and institutionalized racism and violence that the Black Community continues to endure are not new. However, as I watch the news, listen, and read, I know I am on my own journey of learning. While I don't pretend to be even close to truly understanding the multi-faceted experiences within the Black community, I am now, more than ever, open to listening, understanding, and lending our voice -- as a company that connects the world -- to take action for social and racial equity.

      At Zoom, acknowledging these realities is not a choice - we are a company that is built on caring for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves. So what does this mean? I'm not 100% sure yet. The first step is this message to all of you - to acknowledge that many of you may be hurting, to acknowledge that while I don't fully understand that hurt, you are visible.

      As a next step, I'll be working with our leadership team, including our new Chief Diversity Officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, to figure out how to best learn more about social and racial justice and engage an act as an organization. We will also assess how best to activate the power of philanthropy to support some of the external partners who are on the frontlines of tackling the goals of social and racial justice.

      We look forward to continuing to figure out ways to lock arms with our employees, partners and others to stand together in non-violence against racism, injustice, and violence not only today, but also in the future.

      Eric
