      In this moment, words are not enough. As a brand and within our own team, we have not done enough. We must make the choice to share the burden of systemic racism and inequality; to leverage our privilege and platform to speak on injustices; and to challenge racism in our daily lives and in the systems of our country. We must act because Black Lives Matter. ⁣

      While we may not know all the answers, over the last few days we have heard the resounding calls for meaningful action. We are committing to education, understanding, and accountability - here is how we will begin our journey towards anti-racism and towards being better:⁣

      ▪️$10,000 commitment to NAACP Legal Defense Fund starting this fiscal year.⁣

      ▪️Immediate development of an internal Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DEI) Team; we will seek out Black and People of Color leaders as consultants for this new committee. We pledge actionable accountability of internal reports on BUFF® DEI. ⁣

      ▪️Commitment to the creation of new collaborations and expanded partnerships with Black and People of Color youth programs and organizations.⁣

      We welcome your voices as we shape new BUFF® initiatives and funding programs. Join us in moving forward together, hold us accountable. Please listen and amplify the Black community. Mobilize your empathy, speak out for justice, and make your vote count in local elections and in November.
