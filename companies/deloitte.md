      Deloitte stands against systemic bias, racism and unequal treatment

      As an organization deeply committed to inclusion, Deloitte stands against the legacy of systemic bias, racism and unequal treatment that continues to plague our communities.

      We must address the social injustice in our communities and cannot remain silent. That’s why I want to share a note that Janet Foutty, chair of the board for Deloitte US, and I sent more broadly to our people to commit to drive meaningful and lasting change in our communities.

      Colleagues,

      It is with great sadness that we share this brief note, only a few days after communicating with you about racism in our country broadly, as well as recent senseless tragedies that have occurred. While there are no words to adequately describe the anger and hurt we are both feeling today, we felt that silence is simply unacceptable—and we know that you share in that sentiment. In that spirit, we express our unwavering commitment to stand against the legacy of systemic bias, racism, and unequal treatment that continues to plague our communities with frightening frequency. The black community in particular is experiencing unspeakable trauma.

      We have each made a meaningful personal donation today to organizations that are committed to bringing about social justice and repairing our communities. Our commitment to you is that we’ll be back in touch, shortly, with specificity as to the plan we will execute to ensure Deloitte is leading the change we want to see. Words, emails, and donations don’t suffice.

      In solidarity,

      Joe Ucuzoglu and Janet Foutty

      Diversity and Inclusion - Our vision

      Our people have a strong sense of belonging and can be their true selves, which comes with diversity, respect and inclusion. Our people feel they can give feedback and speak up if they feel they are being treated unfairly or experience anything that goes against our zero-tolerance policy on discrimination.

      We responded to the Black Lives Matter movement by hosting a series of listening sessions for our people across all parts of the firm. These sessions included hearing from and understanding the experiences of our Black colleagues.

      The action plan was launched via a firmwide webinar to 20,000 of Deloitte’s people hosted by Richard Houston, UK CEO, and Dimple Agarwal, deputy CEO and managing partner for people and purpose. Dimple said: “We have listened, learned and started an important journey with people across the firm and with our Black colleagues. I want to personally thank my colleagues who have shared their stories so courageously and provided honest feedback. I have been humbled, saddened and shocked by what I’ve heard.

      “We are deeply committed to this action plan and the wider commitment by the firm that we can, and will, make a change.”
