      American Hiking Society believes that the outdoors should be a place of healing and enjoyment for all.  Yet people of color, especially black folks, continue to be unsafe from microagressions, harassment, violence, and even murder, simply for being outside.  Make no mistake, our mission, 'empowering ALL to enjoy, share, and preserve the hiking experience' will never be fulfilled until systemic racism is erased and black bodies are safe outside.  We resolve, every day, long after the current news cycle has moved on, to re-commit to doing what we can as American Hiking to root out racism in the outdoors.
