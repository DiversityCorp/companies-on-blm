      <p class="statement">
        Last week, I wrote a letter to the General Motors team about what’s happening in the world today. I received hundreds of responses from employees – many with words of support; some with words of skepticism about whether things will really change; and others still with personal stories of how racism has impacted their life.  As a mom of two, these stories broke my heart.
The first thing I wrote in the letter were the names: George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What is happening today is not nameless or faceless. These names and faces are important and they add to an unconscionable list of Black Americans who have lost their lives based on the color of their skin.
I told the GM team that I am both impatient and disgusted by the fact that as a nation, we seem to be placated by the passive discussion of “why.” Why does this happen?  Why can’t we get to a different place? Why is the response so visceral?  
Today I stood alongside the mayor of Detroit and local leaders and made a commitment to our hometown and to the nation: we will no longer allow our company the indulgence of asking “why.”  We as a company will focus on “what.” What can we do?
For us, we want to be part of meaningful, deliberate change. We will not allow ourselves the passivity of urging others to act. We will act. Because there comes a time when we are compelled to stop diagnosing what is wrong and to start doing what is right. And based on GM’s longstanding values, here is what that looks like:
1) We commit to inclusion – that means creating the conditions where every single human who believes in inclusion is welcome within our walls. Where those conditions do not currently exist, we will bring forth the resources and the rigor to ensure that they do. We know we’re not perfect. Pretending to be is part of the problem. To any GM employees who have the courage to speak up – we will hear you.
2) We unequivocally condemn intolerance – that means racism, bigotry, discrimination, and any other form of named or unnamed hatred. Where hatred exists within our house, we will root it out. To any GM employees who feel like they cannot bring their full self to work – we will see you.
3) We stand up against injustice – that means taking the risk of expressing an unpopular or polarizing point of view, because complacency and complicity sit in the shadow of silence. To any GM employees who feel like we should leverage GM’s voice – we will speak out.
At GM, with COVID-19 and the longer pandemic of systemic racism, we know we all need to move through the world in a new way. For us, this means aspiring to be the most inclusive company in the world. And our hope is that every company will do the same. And while there may not be a precise roadmap for how that will happen, that is no excuse not to try. Inclusion will be a north star for us. And every day, we will take steps in service of our aspiration.  
Awareness leads to dialogue…dialogue leads to understanding…and understanding leads to change.

      <p class="statement">
        General Motors Designates \$10 Million to Support Organizations Which Promote Inclusion and Racial Justice 2020-06-05
Donations include combination of Corporate Giving and Matching of Employee Contributions Initial $1 Million will go to NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to help root out racism, bigotry and discrimination    Detroit – General Motors announced today it has designated $10 million to support organizations that promote inclusion and racial justice. An initial \$1 million will go to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
Recipients of additional funding will be determined with input from GM’s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and the recently announced GM Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB). GM’s IAB will consist of leaders from inside and outside the company, with the goal of making GM the most inclusive company in the world. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra will chair the IAB.
The GM program includes the opportunity for employees to give to organizations, and a corporate matching of those employee contributions. The employee contributions and the GM matching funds are part of the \$10 million. Program details will be distributed to employees when finalized.
“Through today’s donations, GM is taking action in helping root out intolerance – and that means racism, bigotry, discrimination and any other form of hatred,” said Barra. “We want to be part of meaningful, deliberate change and we will not allow ourselves the passivity of urging others to act. We are taking action.”
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is America’s premier legal organization fighting for racial justice. Through litigation, advocacy and public education, LDF seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans. LDF also defends the gains and protections won over the past 75 years of civil rights struggle, and works to improve the quality and diversity of judicial and executive appointments.
Barra was also recently named to the Business Roundtable’s (BRT) Special Committee for Racial Equality and Justice.
