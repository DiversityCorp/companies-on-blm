      We stand together to do better. st8.fm/better

      "The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others are unnecessary tragedies we are outraged and saddened by. These times are a stark reminder that our society still suffers from far too many cases of distrust, hatred, and racism. This is not the world we should accept as a society. We must push ourselves to influence change and create compassion. State Farm has long been committed to helping build safer, stronger communities. We embrace the responsibility to work with others to make the world around us better."
