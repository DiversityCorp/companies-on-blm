      Our collective: believes that Black lives matter, stands against racism and inequality, and wants to be part of the change.⁠
      .⁠
      At JAM Collective, we are in the business of making connections and strengthening relationships. Our job is to promote the clients we represent, working primarily behind the scenes. Today, we are stepping out to make a commitment to channel our frustration and sadness into impactful action. Moving forward, we will use our platforms and expertise to collectively support the voices of the unheard and amplify the rallying cries for justice and equality.⁠

      This week we have paused our regularly scheduled JAM Sessions and our team has compiled resources to continue to educate ourselves as well as a list of organizations to support and voices to amplify. You can find those at the link in our bio.⁠
