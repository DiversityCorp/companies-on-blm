      Since our mission is to remove barriers between humans and nature, **we see the recent acts of racial violence across our nation as a painful reminder** of the **deep barriers people of color face in every aspect of their lives. Mother Nature does not discriminate based on race, gender, orientation, ability or income.** Nor will we.

      **We are parents, we are children, we are joggers, we are birders, we are family.** We are not perfect but we continuously strive to set higher standards for ourselves and our future and we commit to doing more.

      We stand with you all.
