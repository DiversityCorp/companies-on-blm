      We stand in solidarity.

      We cannot go on with our regularly scheduled content when our country continues to be plagued by systemic racism, discrimination, and oppression. We will not be silent on this. We need to use this platform to show where we stand and to do everything in our power to shout out loud that Black lives matter. When we unify, we can make change happen.

      We ask you to use your voice and your platform to come together in support of diversity and inclusion. Speak loudly for those who are not being heard. You may feel helpless right now, but there are ways to act if you can't attend protests. You can educate yourself on how to be an ally, start open conversations with friends and family, sign petitions at colorofchange.org, donate to the BLM Fund and Minnesota Freedom Fund, voice your opinion on social media.

      We are working to be strong allies and if you have information or other ways to support Black lives matter, please comment below or DM us. Together, we are stronger.
