      This week we looked on with anxiety and tears as a bandage was ripped from a long-festering wound. As Minnesota natives, we watched our old stomping grounds burn and witnessed our countryâ€™s raw pain laid bare. We saw a white woman weaponize her privilege against a black outdoorsperson. We struggled to grasp just how disproportionately the COVID-19 crisis has impacted people of color.
      The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and an outrageous number of others, including, last year, Osaze Osagie in our Pennsylvania town, expose the deeply broken systems and institutions in our country.
      If you are white and you are skeptical or confused by what black people are saying and experiencing, know that we all have work to do; we need to read and listen so we can become adept at recognizing and understanding how deeply unjust our society is and how it can be fixed. It must be fixed. We must work tirelessly until it is fixed. Only then will the promise of freedom and the American dream be fully realized.
      For our followers and customers who are black, brown, indigenous, LGBTQ, disabled, or otherwise marginalized, we see you and stand with you and will work for a world where we all have the freedom to exist, thrive, and explore the outdoors without fear and hate. #organicclimbing #SolarSewn
