      We have work to do.

      We join with those who call out the names of George Floyd and too many others in sorrow and anger.

      We stand with those who know racism in America is systemic and pervasive.

      We belive that environmental and social justice are inextricably linked.

      We call on businesses to work with government and civil society to support safe and thriving communities.

      We know nonviolent activism pushes progress.

      We have work to do.

      We’re inspired by our friend and colleague @greengirlleah

      •Social justice cannot wait. It is not an optional “add-on” to environmentalism. It is unfair to opt in and out of caring about racial injustices when many of us cannot. These injustices are happening to our parents, our children, our family and our friends. I’m calling on the environmentalist community to stand in solidarity with the black lives matter movement and with Black, Indigenous + POC communities impacted daily by both social and environmental injustice.

      Patagonia condemns the assault on the US Capitol an all recent attempts to disrupt a peaceful transition of presidential power. We are also appalled by the double standard in the response to Wednesday's insurrection compared to last summer's Black Lives Matter protests. We support leaders from around the country who are calling for the president and his enablers to be removed from office immediately. We are committed, as ever, to doing our part to support our democracy and to ensure that it is equitable and accessible for everyone.
