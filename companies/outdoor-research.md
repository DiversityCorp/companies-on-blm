      We hear you
      We see you
      We want to talk
      We want to listen

      To those who are suffering we say this, we see you, we hear you, we want to talk, we want to listen.
      We have struggled with how to address the current events surrounding the murder of George Floyd and those before him. We live in a country that has history of systemic and institutionalized racism and discrimination against marginalized and underrepresented communities. This is our reality.

      We cannot and will not allow the challenge of finding the “right” words to stop us from breaking our silence.
      We are using our voice to draw attention to this issue. Conversations are pivotal to finding a peaceful path forward. That’s why this dialogue cannot stop. That’s why we’re breaking our silence. Black lives matter.
