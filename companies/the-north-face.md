      We know and acknowledge that for too long, racism has made the world unequal and unsafe. We recognize the pain and suffering racism has caused and are making a commitment to be part of the solution. We are standing up, because we owe it to everyone affected, ourselves and you.

      Black lives matter. We are outraged and devastated by the racism, injustice and brutality that persists across the world.

      We’ve spent the past weeks listening, learning and reflecting on our own challenges as a brand, and how our privilege has made inaction a reality for far too long. While confronting the systematic inequalities that affect the Black community is the first step—it isn’t enough, and we’re committed to demanding more from ourselves.

      To combat racism now, we’re donating $50,000 to ACLU to support their work on police accountability, racial justice and defending the right to protest.

      In the past two years, our Explore Fund has donated $1.5 million to organizations fostering equality in the outdoors, but we need to do more. Moving forward, the focus of our Explore Fund will be solely on addressing and eliminating barriers that prevent safe exploration, creating access for all. We're immediately donating $25,000 to our long-term partner Outdoor Afro, the leading organization for Black connections and leadership in nature. We're also donating $25,000 to PGM ONE Summit our partner that centers Black, Indigenous, and people of color to lead our movements for environmental justice and collective liberation.

      For lasting change, we must change the way we work for good. From reassessing our partnerships and working with community leaders committed to societal change, to bringing more Black and athletes of color to our global team, reflecting the stories and faces we are missing today. Every action counts, and we are dedicated to the changes that must start today.
