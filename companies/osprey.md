      At our core, we are steadfast in our resolve to leave our world better than we found it. Because of that, we’re choosing not to stay silent on the events of this past week and our nation’s long history of systemic racism. We believe there is simply no place for hatred in our communities, in our outdoor spaces—anywhere in the world, period. We stand with the black community to condemn senseless deaths and injustices that permeate all facets of our society.

      We realize sharing our beliefs is a small step, and we’re pushing ourselves to do better. Better starts with listening more and developing an evolving action plan.

      Starting today, we plan to use our platform for good and to ensure BIPOC voices are heard—that means giving them a platform to speak about experiences, better representing people of color through all of our stories and diversifying the non-profits we partner with to better support our core values.

      Our community is open and inclusive to all. Our differences fuel our strengths. Together we can end inequality—and we have no patience for those who say that’s impossible.
