      Over the past week, I, like many of you, have been having some very difficult conversations, both at Title Nine and at home. Our discussions have centered around two inseperable issues: the invisible tailwinds of white privilege and the battering headwinds of systemic racism.

      These discussions are hard and past-due. They are personal. They are necessary.

      What I know from a lifetime of grappling with my own racism and my white privilege is that transformation is personal, painstaking, and slow. And yet, what has been a deeply personal process for me has become an issue that every corporation wants to talk about.

      But more importantly, many T9ers want to talk about it too. And they have talked in ways both frank and urgent.

      Yesterday, our Head of Distribution, Marcus, reminded me: "We cannot be silent."

      And it was our Head of Customer Service who spurred me out of thought and into action: "We have had hundreds of years to listen to black people. Now is the time for action."

      And she connected all the dots aligning our mission with the greater cause of racial justice: "Title Nine supports women who own, risk, and lead. And right now we need to support black women."

      Enough said.

      So, what does that look like for Title Nine:

      - Starting immediately, we are contributing $10,000 to bail-out funds that help black women activists.

      - Starting immediately, we are contributing $10,000 each to two organizations that support reproductive justice in the black community: SisterSong and ARC-Southeast.

      - Starting immediately, we are contributing $10,000 to the Equal Justice Initiative which fights to end racial inequalities in our criminal justice system.

      - We have offered paid time off to any T9er who would like to participate in peaceful protests in their community.

      These actions are a small step, a start, but they cannot be the finish.

      Here at T9, we are 300-strong, but we are only one small company. It will be up to all of us to support in both time and money, to protest, and to vote.

      We will be better. We must be.

      Thank you for reading,
