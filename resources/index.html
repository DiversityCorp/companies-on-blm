                    While it&#39;s become common for major tech companies to hire diversity and inclusion executives, many startups don&#39;t make it a top priority early on, which can affect the way the company grows. Moving Beyond&#39;s Rae also said that companies should be publicly and explicitly detailing their plans to diversify company leadership and boards of directors, and focus on approaches grounded in data.

Facebook hasn&#39;t tweeted since May 21, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on the company&#39;s Facebook page yesterday saying that &quot;We stand with the Black community - and all those working towards justice in honor of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and far too many others whose names will not be forgotten.&quot;

                    People weren&#39;t mad about the content of these statements. They simply distrusted the intentions and track record of the companies making them. Your company has been silent on virtually every social issue for as long as people can remember. Do you really think that people will be ready to ignore all of that to praise a bandwagon statement out of the blue? If your company falls in this category, values-based social media marketing or public statements on social issues should be the LAST thing you do.

                    If you&#39;re prioritizing the needs of the most marginalized folks, then you might pay less attention to the discomfort of white people in the process of meeting Black people&#39;s needs. Too often, DEI workshops end up centering the needs of white people and their comfort, which end up causing further harm to the marginalized people in the room.DEI work&#39;s success is determined by marginalized people, not those in positions of power.

                    System beating may come across as professional and proper, but it is really a strategy for coping with the denial, the resistance, the cultural incompetence, and &quot;The fragility of white people,&quot; as Robin DiAngelos has termed it. Even the words diversity and inclusion were strategic ways to point to inequities in a less troublesome way so that people in groups that have been privileged by racism wouldn&#39;t be scared off from addressing the inexplicable imbalances in almost all areas of our society.
