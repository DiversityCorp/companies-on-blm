To that end, we offer this solemn white-on-black .jpeg that expresses vague solidarity with the Black community, but will quietly elide the specifics of what is wrong, what needs to change, or in what ways we will do anything about it. This is doubly true if [Brand] is particularly guilty of exacerbating these issues. We hope this action encourages you to view [Brand] positively without, you know, expecting anything from us.

				<p>Corporate America has largely ignored the issues of police brutality and systemic racism. After the murder of George Floyd, thousands of black &amp; white statements flooded social media, claiming that they are listening and will no longer be complicit. Some of these were specific, measurable, and actionable, and some of them were little more than a black box with a hashtag. We've gathered their initial responses and subsequent follow-ups so you can start sorting through which organizations are genuinely invested and interested in making a difference and which are not.</p>
